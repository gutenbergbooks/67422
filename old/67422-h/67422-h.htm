<p class="drop-cap"><span style="margin-left: 0.2em">HE </span>
was straight, and grizzled, and keen of eye.
He had worked, and fought, and gambled his
way through the lawlessness and passion of
the State's early life into the decency and uprightness
of a successful contractor.</p>

<p>His name was Bill Bowen.</p>

<p>As a civil engineer, I came more or less in contact with him,
and rejoiced in the largeness of his mental mold, as well as in
the business sense of security he let me enjoy.</p>

<p>One summer's night we took a drive to a distant town on the
San Joaquin River. We were to look at stone for bridge building,
and the blistering heat of the day made us willing to lose our
sleep for the more comfortable traveling by starlight.
</p>
<p>The horses jogged lazily through the coarse, thick dust on the
river's levee, and the insects from the grain fields and the frogs
from the sloughs had things wholly to themselves until Bill
suddenly interrupted.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Chase is pretty enough yet to understand why she sent
two fellows to the devil, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" I answered.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Bill, pulling himself up, "I forgot you didn't
struggle with the rest of us through those groggy days."

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>I knew Bill well enough to let him relapse just so many minutes;
then I said: "Judge Chase's wife is lovelier at sixty than
most girls at sixteen, but I hadn't an idea she figured so romantically
in the early days as to send anybody overboard."</p>

<p>"H'm," replied Bill reflectively.</p>

<p>The horses traveled on without attention, and I waited in
patience.</p>

<p>"You know what it was like," he began at last. "Men with
guns from all over the Union and gold the heaven we sweated
for. Prayers, and court, and the gambling tables all running
under one roof, and nary a woman's face showing up in the mass
to give us courage. To be sure, there were vixenish ribs o' Satan
who robbed, and killed, and drank with the worst of us; but until
'51 we'd never the woman for reverence. Then, by degrees, the
lawyers and a stray merchant or two aired their families, but things
wasn't dizzy till pretty Grace Blanchard got out with her father.</p>

<p>"Understand, she carried herself as she'd ought to; but, understand,
there was men among us as was born and bred to live with
blood. The mass of us had to take out our satisfaction in looking
at her; but for two the favor in old Blanchard's eyes was
easy reading, and it wasn't long seeing the course the straw took.
</p>
<p>"Ned Emory was a long, lean, blond fellow, with a blamed fine
face and a way that made friends of the toughest. They said he
looked a swell when he called at the Blanchards', but I never saw
him but like the rest of us,&mdash;red-shirted and overalled, and an
angle to his pistols that made him a joy.</p>

<p>"George Stokes&mdash;'Shorty,' we called him&mdash;was a man with
an answer that ripped like a knife and a head that made success
of everything, because it could work crooked as well as straight.
He'd been on the bench, but he'd located a vein at Mariposa, and
was overseeing up there in '52. Naturally, he lost opportunities,
not being right on the spot, and the danger began.</p>

<p>"The Blanchard house was swelled larger than most of the
cabins, and had two long windows that opened onto a porch.
Things might never have been so bad but for those two lidless
eyes in front.</p>

<p>"One fatal night Shorty Stokes rode into the settlement,&mdash;but
I'm getting ahead of affairs."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>Bill tossed his cigar into the tules, and hurried the horses into
effort as the interest of his reminiscence swept him on.</p>

<p>"The girl carried herself after the fashion of high steppers, and
neither fellow could swear where he stood. It was laughter and
spirit for both of them, they said, and nip and tuck for the yielding.
The pace was the sort that exhausts men, and Shorty's brain
for lawyering cooked up a scheme for his rescue. He was for
their going together some night before her, and, after a formal
marriage proposal, each argue his claim and fitness for ten minutes
by the clock, their honor at stake to stand by her decision.</p>

<p>"It got about afterwards that Emory wouldn't consent till he
saw the devil to pay in Shorty's earnestness, and they swore with
their fists in each other's to carry the thing through to the finish.
The date and hour were arranged for the following Sunday night
at eight, and they drank to it with gall in the cup.</p>

<p>"When the evening came the clock had already struck eight
when Stokes reached the Blanchard house.</p>

<p>"The lights from the room fell over the porch, and from the
shadow of the steps he saw the something that in all the world
he couldn't bear to see,&mdash;Emory crossing the room to take Grace
Blanchard in his arms; Emory with passion paling his face and
Grace Blanchard in the beauty of a disturbing humility.</p>

<p>"He cursed as he watched them cling to each other, and he
cursed his way back to the saloons and his Mariposa mining.</p>

<p>"The next day he turned up again in the settlement, with liquor
enough aboard to put a wheel in his head, and, after a losing fling
at the tables, he started to find Emory.</p>

<p>"After a little ineffectual riding, he leaped from the back of
his vicious-eyed piebald at the corner that bulged thickest with
saloons, and stood close to the stirrup with his hand on his hip.
Some one who noticed him said his face had the steely intensity of
a razor edge.</p>

<p>"Then out of the crowd, unconscious, with the music of love
in his heart, swung Ned Emory. His hat was pushed back on his
fair hair, and he was whistling the overflow out of his veins.</p>

<p>"In one instant a bullet rang through the air, followed by
another. Emory fell in his own blood, and a horseman was riding
off wildly and safe through the shower of bullets that rained

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>

around him. Every man with a cayuse tore in pursuit, but they
only brought back eight half-dead horses. Stokes had staked
relay beasts at different points along the road, and was then safe
in the chaparral cañons toward the north.</p>

<p>"The gambling dens choked up with the crowds; gold-dust was
heaped on gold-dust for the reward of the cowardly hound. Murders
weren't rare then, but there was only one Ned Emory, remember.</p>

<p>"Four of us wouldn't drop the search. We let the blood-money
men get out of the way, and then we worked as we'd toil for only
our own.</p>

<p>"There was scarcely no scent to follow, for Stokes had bribed
the greasers who furnished his horses; but we forced our way along
on nothing. Day and night we rode with our eyes open, sometimes
bullying and sometimes begging. It began to seem hopeless.
The days were running into summer again.</p>

<p>"One afternoon, toward twilight, we rested on the crest of a
mountain where the path took a sudden turn away from a two-hundred-foot
precipice.</p>

<p>"We were torn with the snapping branches of the greasewood,
and full of extremest dirt and disgust. Suddenly we heard the
rustle of a step on the fallen leaves. Under a live oak, not thirty
yards away, on the very edge of the cliff, stood Shorty Stokes.
He had not heard us, and he stood looking at the moon which
hung a sickle in the hot sky. The evening star was showing.</p>

<p>"The four of us were like stones. He could have got to Guinea
before motion'd have come to us. Then, simultaneously with
our steps forward, he turned and looked into our faces.</p>

<p>"It was a moment to test the nerve of any man. He stood it as
we were used to seeing him face all things.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'I suppose I'm the man you're after,' he said.</p>

<p>"He said it with the dignity of a parson.</p>

<p>"In a second he had thrown down his pistols. He unsheathed
his knives and dropped them to the ground.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Take me,' he said.</p>

<p>"Four of us looked into the unflinching clearness of his eyes.
As we hesitated, he spoke again.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Listen. It is not in excuse that I speak, nor in weakening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>It is to tell you that those among you who are men will follow
my steps under like circumstances.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Emory gave me his hand and his oath, in the manner of his
frankness, to stand by an arranged agreement.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'We were to meet at eight o'clock on that Sunday night. A&mdash;a
beautifully good woman was to decide on our argument which
man she would marry. In riding to meet my engagement I happened
on an accident. Within half a mile of the settlement, close
onto time, my piebald went back on his haunches and the groan
of a man came up from the roadside. I found an overloaded
miner, hurt in the leg, and the hope in my own heart aroused my
sympathy. I mounted the man on my beast and headed him back
toward camp.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Walk as I never walked, I reached the meeting place three
minutes late. Ah&mdash;God&mdash;out in the darkness I saw Emory taking
advantage of the delay.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'None of you is so much a cur as to let the life run in a man
who, under his honor, couldn't yield a rival three minutes' grace.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'But, with the camp against me and Emory the friend of the
sorriest, I couldn't face the music when the justice was done.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'It is not mercy I ask. It is life hereafter. Come.'</p>

<p>"With a common impulse we started forward, only to halt in a
frozen horror as Stokes' bronco threw up his head in alarm to
watch with us the backward somersaulting of his master's body
over the precipice.</p>

<p>"Though there was but one verdict, even Chase said as we rode
down over the mountain that night, 'Emory might have given
Shorty a few minutes' grace.'&thinsp;"</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span style="margin-left: 0.2em">THE </span>
ferry-boat, "Rappahannock," had an experience
in the winter of 1873 that will never be
forgotten by any of her passengers.</p>

<p>During one of her regular trips between
New York and Brooklyn this boat suddenly
quitted her respectable, though somewhat monotonous,
career, and became a common tramp, without port or
destination.</p>

<p>The day awoke in fog such as the oldest inhabitant had never
seen. The East River was blocked with ice and soon became a
shrieking bedlam of groping and bewildering craft, whose pilots
could scarcely see their hands before their faces.</p>

<p>At half past nine the "Rappahannock" left Brooklyn, well
laden with passengers, and started on her customary trip almost
directly across the river&mdash;a very short and unusually easy
voyage. Before even reaching the middle of the stream, however,
the ice and fog had thrown her completely out of her
course. Back and forth, up and down stream, the pilot vainly
groped, amid the shrieking whistles, ringing of fog bells, and loud
crash of ice boulders, until, in the confused clangor, he had
entirely lost his bearings.</p>

<p>When, after long and perilous battling with ice jams and many
hair-breadth escapes from collisions, he suddenly sighted the
landing place on the New York side, he found it occupied by a
sister boat, which had been driven there to avoid destruction. He
backed out, only to be lost again, and for three hours this boat,
now become a mere tramp, wandered aimlessly up and down the
East River with its load of excited passengers, whose emotions
ranged anywhere between the rage and impatience of the belated
Wall Street speculator, to whom the delay might mean a loss of
fifty thousand dollars, to the hysteria of a nervous little woman

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span>

who had left her baby alone at home, and who begged the other
helpless passengers for the love of heaven to help her set her feet
once more on land.</p>

<p>Between these two extremes of impatience and excitement was
a small proportion of passengers who remained calm, even endeavoring
to while away the time by exchanging pleasantries and making
wagers as to the time of their deliverance. Among these was
a group of men in the cabin who, after having read and re-read
the morning papers, were casting about for some other method of
killing time. One suggested a game of cards.</p>

<p>"Cards!" laughed one of his companions in misery. "Who'd
carry cards on a ferry-boat? Who, outside of a lunatic asylum,
would start on a ten minutes' voyage provided with games to pass
away the time?"</p>

<p>"Here is a euchre deck which is at your service."</p>

<p>The speaker, evidently a globe-trotter, drew from under the
bench a traveling-bag, so much worn and embellished by tags,
labels, and hieroglyphics that it resembled some old veteran just
returned from the wars and still covered with surgeons' plasters.
From this he produced a pack of cards and tendered it to the man
who had suggested a game.</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you will join us; but what shall we do for a
table?"</p>

<p>"Here is a camp-stool," said the man of the world. And in a
moment four men were sitting around it, cutting for deal, which
chanced to fall to the stranger.</p>

<p>The cards were distributed rapidly, and the dealer was about
to turn the trump when a loud shriek pierced the air and a woman
opposite suddenly sank fainting to the floor.</p>

<p>The tension among the passengers had become so great that
a panic seemed imminent.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, gentlemen; it is nothing serious," said the
dealer calmly. "The lady simply caught sight of her own frightened
face in the mirror, and the shock caused her to faint. It
reminds me of a thrilling experience an American traveler had
while bumping through Syria. But, pardon me, the game!"</p>

<p>Once more he made a movement to turn the trump, when one
of the party exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>"There can't be a better time or place than this for telling a
thrilling experience."</p>

<p>"Yes," said another; "do give us some other kind of bumping
than we are having here. Let's have the story before we begin
the game."</p>

<p>The stranger leaned back, passed his cigar case, and, having
lighted a weed himself, began:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is an unwritten law among the wild Bedouins east of the
Red Sea that if an infidel traveler is attended on his journey by
one of the faithful he is safe from the attacks of Mohammedan
robbers. As long as the 'Frank,' as all foreigners are called, is
under the protection of the Star and Crescent, the rascal's hand is
stayed, and as they meet, the villain, who would otherwise show
no quarter, salutes with the grave suavity of a courtier. But let
that same traveler become separated from the Arab guard that he
has bribed to give him safe conduct through his own bandit-infested
country, and he becomes legitimate prey. He will be
plundered and perhaps killed, or, worse, if the robber thinks that
cruelty will extort any secrets of hidden spoil, tortured or held
for ransom, with each day's delay losing a few fingers, which are
forwarded to the captive's friends to signify that the rascals mean
business.</p>

<p>"The party in which this American was traveling had been
entering Syria from the south, and were progressed some twelve
days from the sacred base of old Sinai. At a place called Bir-es-Sheba,
on the regular caravan route to and from Mecca from the
north, they heard of some interesting archeological treasures just
unearthed some two days' journey to the east, and, having made
the detour, the party snugly encamped by the side of a beautiful
stream under the shadow of the Tubal chain of mountains.</p>

<p>"The treasures were vastly exaggerated, as is the custom with
everything oriental, and they soon determined to turn back to the
caravan route and 'bump' on up into Syria&mdash;'bumping' being
the familiar term for camel riding, and a very expressive word at
that. But on the afternoon of the first resting-day some one suggested
a jaunt to a famous old well, where it was said were some
very ancient tumuli. But, knowing the Bedouins to be conscientious
liars, and sick of this unrewarded chase for phantom treasures,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>

the American begged to be left behind in charge of two
tents, which were pitched side by side on the bank of the stream.</p>

<p>"This was at last agreed upon, the whole party except himself
going off on their three days' trip, leaving their comrade stretched
at full length on a rug, his <i>narghili</i>, or water pipe, lighted for company.</p>

<p>"This oriental atmosphere, gentlemen, is a powerful drug. Do
what you will to fight against it, its subtle charm holds you captive.
The man succumbed to its influences and went fast asleep.</p>

<p>"Out of this sweet, trance-like repose he suddenly bounded into
the horrible consciousness of a torturing pain in one of his hands,
as though some wild beast was crunching the bones. But, as he
writhed to his knees to grapple with the foe, he saw instead three
swarthy, evil-faced Bedouins bending over him with ghoulish glee.
One had just cut off, with a hideous dirk-knife, the first three
fingers of his left hand. In an instant it flashed upon him that
these were to be sent to his friends with a demand for ransom.
He was correct in this supposition, for no sooner had the bleeding
hand been rudely bandaged than two of his captors set out upon
this mission, leaving him in care of the third, who was heavily
armed.</p>

<p>"No one knew better than the prisoner how impossible such a
ransom would be. His fellow-travelers had brought as little
money into Syria as would meet their actual necessities while
there. He therefore began to cast desperately about in his mind
for a loophole of escape before the fellows should return with
these unsatisfactory tidings, which would result, no doubt, in
further mutilations.</p>

<p>"As his gaze swept the tent for something suggesting a plan
for deliverance, he saw it had been gutted of everything except
two articles,&mdash;his light silk coat, which hung upon the partition
between the two tents, and the tourist's shaving mirror which it
concealed. The coat had been overlooked because it was as grimy
as the tent wall itself.</p>

<p>"In moments like this one grasps at straws. As it is said a
drowning person reviews his past experiences perfectly in a brief
moment, so to this man, facing desperate odds, came a desperate
suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>"He called loudly on a supposed protector in the adjoining
tent to come to the 'window,' and prove to his captor that he was
under protection of a Moslem. As he spoke he slowly drew the
coat from before the mirror in front of which the sheik was standing.</p>

<p>"No words can express the unutterable consternation pictured
upon that blazing face, livid with fright and wonder, as for the
first time it saw its own awful reflection, not knowing it was its
own. One instant he stood stock-still, fascinated, horrified, overwhelmed;
then collapsed, just as that lady did but a moment ago,
and the American quickly possessed himself of his captor's arms
and was master of the situation.</p>

<p>"And now, gentlemen," concluded the story teller, "we will
have our game."</p>

<p>As he spoke he again reached forward to turn the trump.
There was a quickly drawn breath of horror from those who
observed him, for the first three fingers of his left hand were
missing.</p>

<p>Before he could turn the card, a savage lurch of the boat, accompanied
by the creaking of timbers, announced the arrival of the
Rappahannock at her New York slip&mdash;and the trump was never
turned.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span style="margin-left:-0.2em">WHEN </span>
I became the occupant of the Chateau
Blanc, in the neighborhood of Fontainebleau,
I found that my wish for a place of complete
seclusion was likely to be realized to the
full. I was not in a state of mind for society,
and I had deliberately given myself three
months in which to fight out a certain battle with myself, for
which I needed solitude and reflection.</p>

<p>When the old woman who acted as keeper and caretaker of the
place took me through it, on a tour of inspection, there were three
things which, in spite of my preoccupation with my own affairs,
struck me very forcibly. The first was the forlorn remnants of
the body of a white swan, which must once have been a creature
of splendid size and shape. My informant told me that this swan
had been a great pet of the former owner of the chateau, until
some accident had killed it; after which it had been stuffed and
fastened in its place upon the surface of the little lake under his
window. There it was still&mdash;what remained of it&mdash;a mass of
weather-beaten and dirty feathers.</p>

<p>Another thing that compelled my strong attention was a certain
picture which hung in the bedroom of the late owner, and which
I was informed was his own portrait, painted by himself. This
room, by the way, was sinister and mysterious in its effect beyond
any I had ever entered. One reason for this was the fact that all
the furniture, which was elaborately carved and which must once
have been of beautiful polish and color, had been ruthlessly covered
with a coat of black paint,&mdash;the bed, the table, chairs,
wardrobe, chests of drawers, and even the great leather easy-chair
which was placed just under the picture, facing the opposite
wall.</p>

<p>It was a wretched piece of work, that picture, representing a

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>

man dressed in some sort of court dress of the last century, and it
would have seemed ineffectual and amateurish to the last degree
but for the truly marvelous expression of the eyes, which were
fixed on a certain spot in the wall opposite with an earnestness
and intensity which made me feel that there was some hidden significance
in this look. The man not only looked at the spot himself,
but he compelled me to do the same, and forced me, by the
insistent command of his eyes, to look again and again.</p>

<p>And yet there was nothing to see. The wall was perfectly
bare in that place and covered with a meaningless sort of wallpaper,
which gave me no encouragement whatever.</p>

<p>Another thing that I noticed specially, with a feeling of being
imperiously directed to do so, was a large rusty key that hung on
the wall directly under the picture. When I inquired of the old
woman what this key belonged to she answered that she had
never known, but that it had been hung there by the late proprietor
and had been undisturbed since his death. That event
had occurred a great many years ago, and it was owing to the
provisions of the will left by him that no one had ever occupied
the house in the interval. The prescribed time had only just
expired, and I was the first person to rent the chateau, the revenue
from which was to go to a nephew, who lived abroad.</p>

<p>The somberness of the black chamber suited my frame of mind,
and I decided on taking it for my room. Besides this, the picture,
the key, and the white swan all interested me, and, as it was
the first time that an outside interest had made any headway
against the melancholy of my own thoughts, these objects, far
from cheerful as they were in themselves, afforded a grateful
diversion.</p>

<p>So continually did I wonder why the picture looked always
and could compel me to look at that one spot, and why the key
had been hung in that place and had kept its position so many
years undisturbed, as if some ghostly guardian watched over it,
and why, ever and always, the old white swan compelled me, as
if by some irresistible power, to connect it with these other things,
that I kept myself awake at night, weaving all sorts of stories
concerning these objects, and spent half my days in looking from
the picture to the wall, and back again to the key, and then out

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>

of the window at the battered effigy of a noble bird beneath it,
until the confusion of mind thus produced seemed likely to drive
me crazy.</p>

<p>I expended all the ingenuity of which I was master in questioning
the old woman, who had lived here in the time of the former
owner, but the satisfaction of my curiosity in that direction was
rather meager.</p>

<p>She told me that her former master had had a wife whom he
adored, fair as an angel, and gifted with a divinely beautiful
voice, such as none had ever heard, before or since. This young
wife had been snatched from him by a sudden and frightful
death. The fever which seized her had been so contagious, the
woman said, that every one had fled the premises, except one
woman servant and the master himself. These, with the help of
the doctor, had nursed the young wife through her brief illness
until its end.</p>

<p>My informant had heard it said that the circumstances of her
death were very peculiar,&mdash;that, in her delirium, on the very last
night of her illness, those who had ventured to linger about the
premises had heard her singing more gloriously than ever in her life;
that it had reminded them of the great white swan, which but
the night before had sung its last sweet song on the lake, in the
moonlight, and had been found dead in the morning.</p>

<p>The woman who had remained to help the master in his last
sad ministrations to his dying and dead wife had gone away the
day after the funeral, and had never been heard of since.</p>

<p>That funeral, in the quaint old church but a few paces from
the house, had been, from the woman's account, a melancholy
affair enough. Scarcely any one dared to come to it, so malignant
had been this fever, and it was feared that the few men who
were willing to act as pall-bearers would not be equal to the
task; but the poor lady had always been slight and fairy-like in
figure, and so wasted was she from this consuming fever that the
bearers declared that her weight was scarcely more than that
of an empty coffin. The woman further said that, as the small
funeral cortege was leaving the church, it had surprised every
one to see the husband, who was directly behind the coffin, pause
abruptly under a statue of the Virgin, and single out, from the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>

great bunch of white ribbons which hung there, the long strip
which his young wife had placed there on the day of her marriage
to him, less than a year before. It was an old custom connected
with this church. Every girl ever married there had conformed
to it, and some of the ribbons were yellow with time and almost
dropping to pieces. The longest and freshest bit of all had been
put there by the beautiful and beloved young creature now lying
dead in the flower of her youth and loveliness.</p>

<p>No one ever knew, the woman went on to say, how the master
spent his days after the funeral was over. He had forbidden
every servant to return, and turned a deaf ear to the rings and
knocks of visitors. Months had passed, and no one held speech
with him. They knew he was alive, because people who had
looked through the palings had seen him walking in the garden,
and one person reported having seen him carry from the house
the stuffed body of the great swan and fasten it in its place on
the lake, where it could be plainly seen from his window. He
must have embalmed or stuffed it himself, the old woman said,
for he was known to have remarkable knowledge and skill in
such strange arts, and had once had a great room filled with birds
and beasts, which he had preserved by methods studied in foreign
lands.</p>

<p>As was inevitable, after hearing all this, my interest in the
picture, and swan, and the key deepened sensibly. There was
certainly a spell of the supernatural about these things for me. I
had only to stand near the spot on which the eyes of the picture were
fastened to experience the strangest, the most overwhelmingly significant
sensations I had ever known. The spot was haunted by a
<i>presence</i> for me, and as often as I stood there I would feel my
heart throb and cease throbbing, my breath pant and cease panting,
my very flesh turn cold and moist with consciousness and apprehension.
I tried to account for all this on natural grounds, but I
found it was quite impossible to do so.</p>

<p>One day&mdash;it was the 19th of August&mdash;a hot, sultry, close,
indescribably gloomy day, when the heavy clouds that lowered
seemed only to darken the whole earth without giving forth one
drop of moisture, the old woman came to my room and chanced
to mention that it was the time of the death of the young mistress

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>

of the Chateau Blanc. She had died, it appeared, just at
midnight between the 19th and 20th of August. After giving me
this information, she said good-evening and left me to the reflections
which it aroused.</p>

<p>I can scarcely call them reflections. They took the form,
rather, of a sort of compulsion that was laid upon me to obey a
certain force by which I felt myself suddenly dominated.</p>

<p>It was the picture that did it; this was certain, for, as often as
I faltered, one look into that insistent, commanding, coercing face
compelled me to go on. In obedience to its bidding, I did as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>I went to an old desk in the room, and took from it some
simple carpenters' tools, with which I deliberately cut through,
first, the wall-papering, and then a thin boarding, which covered
all the space between a door and window opposite the picture.
When this was done I saw&mdash;I cannot say whether most to my
satisfaction or my horror, that I stood opposite a door,&mdash;a regular,
ordinary door, with panels, hinges, and, more than all, a keyhole.
I glanced at the picture. It seemed to me that the canvas positively
lived with expression.</p>

<p>The eyes commanded me to get the rusty key. I got it, fitted
it in the lock, in which it turned with difficulty, and then, with
my heart almost choking me with its throbs, my knees shaking
under me, my body covered with a cold sweat, and my tongue dry
in my mouth, I opened the door.</p>

<p>As it creaked on its rusty hinges, I saw, by the light of the
candle which I held in my hand, a mass of cobwebs, heavily
weighted with the dust of years, and, through these, a woman's
figure.</p>

<p>It was clad&mdash;for I obeyed the eyes, which commanded me to
examine it, though my heart was cold with terror&mdash;in what I
made out to be a white silk gown, above which was the face,
withered and awfully livid, as I had heard the faces of embalmed
corpses appear years after death. Still, it was recognizable as a
real human face, and was surrounded by masses of yellow hair,
which, even through the dust and cobwebs, gleamed with the
brightness of gold. The hands held something in their shrunken
fingers,&mdash;a white ribbon, with the date of her marriage and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>

death upon it, her husband's name and her own, and these words,
which, under the compelling eyes of the picture, I laboriously
studied out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have been able to keep you near me, even in death. I have
never been separated from you, or from what was you to me
once. But when death shall come to me you will have no power
over my body, and they will take me from you. That I am
unable to help. I think only of this: you cannot suffer for it,
since you have so long ceased to be, and by that time my
suffering also will be over. I shall put my spirit into the eyes of
my picture, which will watch over you still."</p>

<p>I looked from the paper to the picture. It seemed dull and
inexpressive,&mdash;mere canvas and paint. The power of the eyes
was gone. Their spell over me was broken.</p>

<p>Suddenly I felt within me a long-absent yearning for human
companionship,&mdash;for life and love. I had come to this place
impelled by a morbid and unhealthy desire for solitude, and my
experiences here had made me more morbid and unhealthy still.
They had culminated now in this awful revelation of disappointment
and death, which threw into brilliant contrast the bright
possibilities which still remained to me, and I resolved to go back
into the world and do my best to deserve and win these.</p>

was Detective Gilbert who told the story to a
group of boarders seated on the piazza of one
of the quaint old Rhinelander houses. These
dwellings, though situated on West Eleventh
Street, in the very heart of New York, present
an almost rural spectacle, with their green
lawns, wide piazzas, and vine-covered balconies.</p>

<p>"It was one day about two years ago," said Mr. Gilbert, "that
I received a card on which was engraved the name, 'Miss Julia
Wood.' The name was a familiar one. When my wife was
living Miss Wood had been an intimate friend of hers and a
frequent visitor to our house. Since then I had lost trace of
the girl, and knew only that, owing to her father's death and the
straitened circumstances of herself and her sister, she had taken
up the study of stenography and typewriting, with the idea of
earning her living. So when she rose to meet me in the reception-room
I was startled by her changed appearance and the haggard,
anxious expression of her face."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Mr. Gilbert, I am in great trouble,' she exclaimed, as I
shook hands with her, and then, without further preliminaries,
she stated her case.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'You know, Mr. Gilbert, that for over a year I have been
studying stenography and typewriting, and you can understand that
lately I have been very anxious to find a place. At first, I
supposed that this would not be difficult, but I soon discovered
that my lack of practical experience stood in the way of my
getting anything at all. In fact, it was not until this week that
even a temporary opening presented itself.'</p>

<p>"Here Miss Wood paused for a moment, as if to summon all
her strength, and then continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'About eleven o'clock yesterday morning, my teacher, Mr. Lacombe,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span>

came to the door of the practice room, where I was at
work, and, calling me to one side, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"Miss Wood, didn't you tell me that you understood the
deaf and dumb alphabet?"</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"Perfectly," I answered.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'As you know, Mr. Gilbert, my little sister Helen is deaf and
dumb, and that is why I understand the sign-language almost as
well as I do spoken English.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"I thought so," said Mr. Lacombe, "and am glad, for your
sake, that you do, for I've just had an application from a lady who
wants a deaf and dumb stenographer."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"But I am not deaf and dumb," I protested.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"No, but you understand the sign-language, and that is the
main point. You see, this woman wants some notes taken from a
deaf and dumb relative, who uses, of course, the deaf and dumb
alphabet, and she thinks, I suppose, that a person who understands
the sign-language must be a deaf mute, also. She says
that this relative of hers is ill; possibly hasn't long to live. So
no doubt you're wanted for some sort of an <i>ante mortem</i> examination;
one, maybe, that's connected with some family scandal or
secret that they don't want to leak out. Just a matter for discretion,
that's all.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"Of course I don't want to urge you into this against your
will," he added, "but I know how much you want a position and
a chance for practical experience. Besides, this engagement is
only for a week, perhaps even less, and the salary is fifty dollars
and all expenses paid. The main question is whether you care to
be deaf and dumb for that time."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'For just a moment I hesitated. Certainly the conditions
were very queer. Still, there was the money,&mdash;how much fifty
dollars would mean for my poor little sister! There was the
experience, and there was, yes&mdash;I must confess it&mdash;there was
the charm of adventure. You know you always said that I was
of an adventurous disposition, and that spirit has grown since
I have been thrown upon my own resources, and have made
up my mind that I must make my own way in the world, as
if I were a man. As for acting the part of a deaf mute, that
seemed a simple matter to me, who know so well the habits of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>

the deaf and dumb, through constant association with poor little
Helen.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Money, experience, and adventure! The combination was
too much for my prudence. In less time than it would take to
buy a handkerchief I had accepted the position. Forty-five minutes
after the time that I walked into Mr. Lacombe's office I sat
on a Southern-bound train, rushing towards a place I'd never
heard of before, the companion of a woman who was an utter
stranger to me, and bound on an errand of which I knew practically
nothing.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'You see, in the rush of preparation I'd no chance for reconsidering
my decision. Indeed, when I was led into Mr. Lacombe's
inner office and introduced to my prospective employer,
Mrs. Westinghouse, by means, of course, of pencil, and paper, and
gestures, I hardly noticed in my excitement what manner of
woman she was. I had enough to think of in keeping to the
character I had assumed and in preparing in half an hour's time
for a week's journey; for almost the first demand made by the
strange woman was that I should go with her upon the noon train.
The invalid had no doubt only a few days left to live, she explained,
and every minute was precious.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Upon reading my pencilled explanation that I must go home
to say good-by to my sister and get a few articles for my trip,
she thrust a ten-dollar bill into my hand, telling me to use that
to buy whatever I needed. Mr. Lacombe, she signified, could
explain matters to my sister, and with that she hurried me down
the stairs and into a cab waiting below. In this I was whirled away,
first to a big department store and then to the railroad station,
arriving just in time for the noon train, so it wasn't until I was
seated in the local express and had actually started that I had a
chance to review the situation and to examine my companion.'</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'What sort of a woman was she?' I interrupted.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Oh, she appeared perfectly respectable, and tried to make
herself agreeable by keeping me busy answering questions on my
pad, but something in her cold gray eyes, or, perhaps, in her high
metallic voice, chilled my ardor. For the first time I realized my
position. Here I was about to enter into the lives of unknown
people, under an assumed character, and one that might involve

me in matters of a secret, perhaps a dangerous nature. By this
time, however, it was too late for me to retreat. All that I could
do was to vow, as I did with all my heart, that no matter what I
learned while with these people I would make no use of it.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Upon leaving the train, after a ride of about two hours and a
half, I found myself in Rockwood, a desolate little way station in
the most dreary section I had ever seen. The only sign of life
was a top carriage, drawn by a pair of lean horses and driven by
the son of my companion, a man about thirty years of age. He
had handsome features, but, somehow, his bloodshot eyes and dissipated
look impressed me even more unfavorably than had his
mother's appearance. I was directed to take the back seat, and
Mrs. Westinghouse sat in front beside her son.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'As we drove off the young man put a question at once
which I did not hear, but his mother in her usual voice assured
him that I was a deaf mute and had been secured at a large salary
for that reason. Then they proceeded with their conversation
without restriction, but the road was so stony and our speed so
great that I caught only a little of it. What I heard did not
serve to make me feel any easier. They spoke of some person,
who appeared to be a relative, with the most dreadful epithets,
and appeared to be planning some way to bring him to terms,
should he prove obstinate after they arrived with the stenographer.
Before we had gone a mile I was not only sick of my bargain, but
ready to jump from the carriage to escape it.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'The aspect of the country, also, was enough to make the
most hilarious person feel melancholy. It was rocky, sterile, and
almost uninhabited. The few farmhouses we passed were, all
save one, untenanted and falling to pieces. The fields were covered
with a thick growth of bayberry bushes or stunted firs.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'The house was, as nearly as I can judge, about three miles
from the station. It had once been a fine mansion, but showed
signs of neglect and age. The paint was worn off in patches; the
floor of the piazza was rotten. The inside of the house, however,
was fairly comfortable, the furniture being extremely old-fashioned
and quaint.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'I could hardly touch a mouthful of supper, and soon excused
myself from the table. Wandering around the piazza

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>

which skirted the house, I came upon a rear view of the premises.
Here I had another surprise, for, detached from the main house
and several yards away, stood a long, low brick building with a
huge chimney, like a smoke-stack, proceeding from it. Its windows
were close against the roof, and probably about twelve feet
from the ground, while the only entrance seemed to be by way of
a rough bridge extending from a curious door on a line with
these windows to a window in the second story of the dwelling-house.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'While I stood gazing at this remarkable building I noticed
that Mrs. Westinghouse had followed me. I could no longer
restrain my curiosity, but pointed to the mysterious building and
raised my eyebrows. With an impatient gesture, as though she
resented my inquisitiveness, the lady caught up my writing-pad
and scribbled: "It is my brother's laboratory; he is a metallurgist.
We wish you to come and take a dictation from him."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Then, leading me upstairs, she unlocked a door and ushered
me into a large apartment, in which, at that moment, I saw only
one object,&mdash;a man stretched upon a couch. The coverings,
thrown away from the neck and face, revealed both to be shockingly
emaciated; the eyes were wild and staring, the lips drawn
away from the teeth, which were white and even. But there
was strength even in that dying despair&mdash;at the first glance I
saw that. There was a look of dogged endurance in every line
and feature.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"Now, Alfred," wrote Mrs. Westinghouse upon my pad and
signifying to me that this was my introduction, "here is Miss
Wood, a deaf and dumb stenographer we have brought from New
York, so there's no longer any reason for your keeping your
precious secret. She understands the signs, and can put your
words on paper as fast as you can give them to her." Then, passing
the pad to the invalid, she turned to her son. "Victor, love,"
she said, "the writing paper, pencils, and a little table for Miss
Wood."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"Here they are," said the young man, rolling the table
towards me with an ingratiating leer.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'I glanced at the invalid. He gave no sign of having read
his relative's communication, but lay quite still and breathed

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>

softly in gasps. I should not have been surprised to have seen
him drawing his last breath at any moment.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'The woman stood looking at him appealingly until she
caught his eye; then she covered her face with her handkerchief,
pretending to be overcome by emotion. A moment later she
turned aside to Victor and hissed, "Oh, is it too late? If I only
knew some torture that would wring from him that secret which
would bring us millions."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Then, controlling herself, she went on more calmly: "Sit
down, Miss Wood, and take the dictation."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'I saw Victor looking at me and had the presence of mind to
remain perfectly quiet, without noticing what she said, for, indeed,
I had now begun to feel that I was among desperate people, and
that it would be best for my well-being to carry out my role as I
had begun it. Apparently satisfied that I was as unfortunate as
I claimed to be, she signified by motions that I was to seat myself
and write as soon as her brother should dictate.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'I did so, but while Victor had been occupied in arranging
my utensils and Mrs. Westinghouse was absorbed in her pretended
emotions the man on the bed had turned his eyes and looked
straight into mine. The effect was tremendous. I felt calmed.
There was almost an understanding between us. At least, there
was sympathy.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'As I seated myself and caught up my pencil, he raised his
white hands and began to sign to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"Show no fright at whatever I say. Pretend to take notes,
or you will betray yourself."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Acting on his suggestion, I began tracing disjointed sentences
upon the paper.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Then, after allowing me a few moments to recover from the
effects of this startling communication, he went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"This is no place for you. These people are desperate
characters, and if they suspected what I am saying might injure
you."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Again a pause, during which I shaded my face with one
hand and scrawled senseless marks over the paper with the other.
Beneath my lowered lids I could see that two pair of eyes, one
bloodshot and the other steely gray, were watching me from a

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span>

shadowy recess on the other side of the bed. I realized that the
slightest expression of my real feelings might prove fatal. I set
my teeth hard. My old adventurous spirit returned. As mechanically
as though I were taking a school dictation, I followed the
movements of the trembling white hand and traced those meaningless
marks.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Apparently, mother and son were satisfied with their scrutiny,
for they soon retired to the other end of the long room. As they
went, I heard her murmur to Victor:&mdash;</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"Come; the old miser won't forget his own flesh and blood.
At any rate, that girl shall stay in the house until her notes
are written out in plain English and the experiments made. I
gave that foolish teacher of hers a wrong address."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'At this she turned on me suddenly, and nothing on earth could
have prevented my face revealing the fright that was on me. I could
hide my terror only by sneezing violently into my handkerchief.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'As soon as they had withdrawn to the farther end of the
room the invalid hastened to communicate as rapidly as possible
the state of affairs in this strange household. The woman, Mrs.
Westinghouse, was, so he said, his sister-in-law, the widow of his
only brother, and Victor was, of course, his nephew. On the
death of his brother, the man who now lay dying had invited the
widow and her son, then a handsome lad, to make their home with
him, and, indeed, had treated Victor as his adopted son and probable
heir. About three years ago, however, Victor, who had acted
as his uncle's assistant in the laboratory, had repaid his generosity
by attempting to steal from him the secret which he had
spent years in perfecting. Failing in this, he had forged his benefactor's
name for a sum amounting to a large share of his fortune,
and had applied the proceeds to the payment of gambling debts.
Since then, Mr. Westinghouse, though allowing Victor to go
free, had refused to see either him or his mother, and it was only
now, when he was on his death-bed, that they returned, uninvited,
with the hope of extracting from the sick man the only wealth
remaining to him,&mdash;his recent discovery.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'At this point the invalid stopped abruptly, and looked once
more deep into my eyes. Then, with a sigh that seemed one of
satisfaction, he continued:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"They think, because they hold me as prisoner here upon my
death-bed, have deprived me of society, and spirited away my
faithful man-servant, the only person who understood my sign-language,
that they can force my secret from me. But your face
tells me that I can trust you, that you are not their accomplice."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"Indeed I am not," I signed hastily. "I came here ignorant
of what I was to do, and now they say that I must stay until the
notes are written out and the experiment is made. If it fails it
is likely to go hard with both of us."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'The invalid received my communication quietly, without
asking how I gained my knowledge. Then, after asking and receiving
answers to several questions in regard to my history, he
nodded as if satisfied, and signed me to take down with extreme
accuracy what he should give me. He then dictated by means
of the sign alphabet what seemed like a technical article, many
words of which he was obliged to spell for me, and including
the finest weights and measures relating to metallurgy. After he
had completed it he asked me to read it to him by signs, so that
he could be sure that it was correct. When I had done so he
looked up, smiled faintly to see that mother and son had left the
room, and beckoned me to him. He took my hands, clasped
them in his, and then signed: "Swear that you will never permit
that paper to fall into the hands of Mrs. Westinghouse or
her son."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'In my fright I took the oath.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"Guard it well," he signified, "for it is a fortune beyond
your dreams. Now sit down and take a bogus paper, which you
must give to Mrs. Westinghouse. But first conceal this paper in
your dress."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'I did so. He then dictated another paper, different in
every way from the first as to its methods; and then motioned
that I must write out the second paper as soon as possible, give it
to Mrs. Westinghouse, and then effect my escape before the fraud
was discovered.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'As I looked at him doubtingly, he added: "Trust me. I
will provide the way."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"But you?" I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>"&thinsp;'He tried to laugh. "I shan't live twenty-four hours," he
said.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'I asked if they were to blame. He shrugged his shoulders.
"Her son's treachery robbed me of health and fortune. And now
in their fiendish greed to inherit the secret they have locked me in
this room and tried to wring it from me by their soft words and
wheedling caresses. But they shall not succeed. They shall
never know this."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'As he spoke he drew from under his pillow a small blade in
a sheath. It was a bright brownish yellow; the edge was sharp as
a razor. He handed it to me, signifying that I was to keep it.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Hardly had I sheathed the strange weapon and concealed it
in the folds of my bodice when the door opened and the woman
again entered. I showed her the pages that I had taken and pencilled
a note, saying that the formula was complete, but that it
would take at least half a day to write it out, as it contained many
unfamiliar terms which I should need to refer to a dictionary.
For just a moment the woman scanned my face and that of the
invalid with that strange air of suspicion that never wholly
deserted her.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Apparently, what she saw satisfied her, for she signified her
pleasure that I had succeeded in gaining the information in so
short a time, and added that, as it was now past midnight, I might
leave the rest of my work for the next day. Upon this, she led
me to a room opening out of her own, indicating that she thought
I might feel less lonely if I were near her. Later, I heard the key
turn softly in the lock on the outside of the door leading from my
room into the hall, and&mdash;well, you can imagine that I got very
little sleep that night.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Early the next morning the woman unlocked my door, and,
after I had eaten a hasty breakfast, led me to a library well
equipped with reference books, where, so she wrote, I was to finish
my work.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Then she left me, locking me in once more.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'I had reached about the middle of the false formula when
the door opened and the woman entered in great haste. From
her hurried movements and the anxious expression of her face I
judged that some new complication had arisen. I was right.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>

Snatching up my pad, the woman wrote, "He is sinking fast. The
experiment must begin at once. How much of the formula
remains?"</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'I wrote: "Over one half."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"Never mind," she wrote in return. "Victor can begin with
what you have. Give me the papers. You may finish the rest
in my brother's room and bring it to us in the laboratory."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'As we entered the invalid's room, I tried to exchange a look
with the sick man, but the woman drew me away to a large
French window at the end farthest from the bed, and, opening
the sashes, which swung inward, motioned me to look out. To
my surprise, I saw that the bridge that I had noticed the night
before as connecting the house and laboratory was approached
from this window. It was a rough affair, resembling those used
on shipboard, and consisted of a wide plank guarded only by
two ropes stretched one on either side of the plank, about three
feet above it, as a sort of guard rail. On the laboratory side the
bridge terminated at what seemed to be a heavy door, made of one
solid piece of timber and provided one third of the way from the
top with two small windows, or, rather, panes of glass, about eight
inches square. Behind each there was a heavy iron bar.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Hastily signifying that I must cross the bridge in order to
bring her the remainder of the formula, the woman sent Victor
ahead and then turned to follow. Before going she intimated to
me that while I wrote I was to remain beside this window where
I could see any sign from the workers in the laboratory and be
seen by them.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'For the next two hours nothing was to be heard in the room
save the scratching of my pen over the paper and the labored
breathing of the dying man. He seemed to be sinking rapidly,
but whenever he caught my glance would smile reassuringly, as
though to say: "Do not be afraid. All will come right." As
the hands of the clock on the mantel approached the hour of
eleven, however, he appeared to grow suddenly stronger; a faint
color tinged his cheeks, and he half rose in bed, as though awaiting
some new developments. On the stroke of eleven he turned
to me and signed: "It is time to go."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"But there are still a few pages to write out," I answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"It's all right," he rejoined. "It is enough. Only go&mdash;go
at once. It is your way of escape."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'For a moment I hesitated. The words sounded senseless;
sick men, I reasoned, had strange fancies. But the glance of his
eyes was sane; it was more,&mdash;it was convincing.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Without another word, I gathered up my papers and started
across the bridge. It swayed, but only slightly. There was not
the slightest danger of an accident. And yet in my passage across
that bridge I trembled violently. When finally I reached the
strangely guarded door I had barely strength enough to knock
upon the heavy timbers. There was no reply. Evidently they were
absorbed in their experiment, I thought, and knocked again. Still
no reply, though this time I seemed to hear a faint movement
within. I tried to peer through the tiny window-panes in the
door. They were somewhat above the level of my face and partly
obscured by the iron bars. So I raised myself on tiptoe and, shading
my eyes with my hands, looked in.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'For a moment I could see nothing. Then, as I became accustomed
to the gloom, I made out a few objects near by,&mdash;a
charcoal stove, a table holding a pair of scales, pincers, blowpipe,
a graduating glass, and other apparatus with which I was unfamiliar.
At the farther end of the table sat a motionless female
figure, the head thrown back, one hand clutching a crumpled sheet
of paper, while the other hung limply at her side. Directly opposite
a man sat, also motionless, his bowed head resting on the edge
of the table. As I looked, I fancied the hand holding the paper
twitched slightly.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'I shifted my position. A faint light fell upon the face of the
woman. It was that of Mrs. Westinghouse, but white and rigid,
with sightless, staring eyes.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"They are dead!" I cried, as I rushed back into the room of
the dying man. Then, recollecting myself, I succeeded in repeating
my words with fingers that trembled so that I could hardly
give the signs.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'For a moment he seemed unmoved; then, with a ghastly smile,
he signalled:&mdash;</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"This is your time to escape."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"But you&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>"&thinsp;'&thinsp;"Never mind me. All I care for is to keep my secret from
them. Remember your vow&mdash;and now go&mdash;go&mdash;and God bless
you."</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'I grasped his hand, then rushed from the room. I snatched
my hat and coat in the hall below, and ran out of the house and
down the road, never stopping until I reached the station. There
I took the next train and reached the city only half an hour ago.'&thinsp;"</p>

<p>Here Mr. Gilbert began to light a cigar, as though his story
were finished.</p>

<p>"But what became of the dying man&mdash;of the mother and
son&mdash;the little stenographer?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, to be sure," said the detective; "you wish to know
the sequel. Well, I went up there that day with two or three
men and found everything as she'd described it. The mother and
son had simply been evidently stupefied by drugs purposely introduced
into the false formula, and soon recovered their senses, but
the uncle had breathed his last. Mrs. Westinghouse had been
smart enough to get a physician, who was there when we arrived,
and who, honestly enough, I suppose, ascribed his death to natural
causes. We could do nothing from lack of evidence."</p>

<p>"But the secret,&mdash;the mysterious formula?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that is the saddest part of the whole affair. Half crazed
by her horrible experience in this house, and recalling her vow to
make no use of any information gained while there, Miss Wood
had no sooner escaped than she tore the true formula into pieces
and threw it away. Had she kept it, it would undoubtedly have
brought her an enormous fortune, for an expert metallurgist who
examined the strange dagger given to her by the dying man pronounced
it to be an example of a priceless art,&mdash;that of tempering
copper to the consistency of steel,&mdash;a process understood by the
ancients, but lost now these thousands of years."</p>

was because the doctor insisted that my system
needed ozone that I went to Colorado on a
hunting trip. It was there that I met her, and
it was there, by the way, that I became convinced
that when a man with a lame lung
undertakes to hunt ozone in the wilds of the
Rocky Mountains he ought to provide himself with a guide. I
went alone, and that's why I got lost.</p>

<p>For two days I had tramped, half starved, toward the rising
sun, with the hope of reaching some cattle ranch near Denver.
On the morning of the third day, as I was trudging through a
thick undergrowth, I was suddenly startled by a woman's voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You didn't happen to spy a little speckled heifer back yonder,
did you, stranger?"</p>

<p>It is said that upon the approach of a human being the first
impulse of a man who has been lost in the woods is that biblically
ascribed to the wicked, namely, "to flee when no man pursueth."
But at this time I was too far gone with hunger and weariness to
flee from anything.</p>

<p>I simply leaned against a tree trunk and awaited the appearance
of the voice's owner. She came riding a bronco across the
crest of a hillock. She was slight and wiry, and she wore her
huge sombrero and man's canvas shooting-coat with an air that at
first suggested the cowboy. A later glimpse of feminine drapery,
however, proclaimed her something infinitely more interesting,&mdash;a
real Rocky Mountain cow-girl in all her glory.</p>

<p>"No," I answered weakly to her repeated question as to the
heifer's whereabouts. "No, I've seen neither hoof nor hide of
your heifer, which is lucky for you, as I should probably have
eaten it if I had."</p>

<p>"You do look hungry," said the strange horsewoman; and as

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>

she spoke the bold lines of her aquiline face relaxed into an expression
of womanly solicitude.</p>

<p>"Here, take this," she added in a business-like tone, producing
from a bag that lay, meal sack fashion, across her saddle, a can of
pressed beef and a square foot or so of corn bread. "No," as I
tried to speak, "never mind explanations. Have some lunch with
me and talk afterwards; that is, if you ain't afraid to eat with a
cow-girl.</p>

<p>"You see," she continued, when we were comfortably seated
on a moss-grown log that served as a whole set of dining-room
furniture, "I know myself what it is to get lost and nearly starve
to death. 'Having experienced misfortune myself, I know how to
pity others.'&thinsp;"</p>

<p>I choked over a morsel of corn bread and stared at my companion
with ill-bred astonishment. A cow-girl who quoted Virgil,
even in a translation, was something not dreamed of in my philosophy.</p>

<p>"Yes, I don't wonder that you look surprised," said my hostess
good-naturedly. "I suppose I don't look as though I was up in
the classics, but the fact is I'm a graduate of Iowa Wesleyan
University, and I've studied Latin, Shakespeare, geometry, and
all the rest.</p>

<p>"Yes," musingly, "once I expected to pursue a literary career.
Indeed, my professors all told me that I might become the George
Eliot or Mrs. Browning of America. But that speckled heifer I
was asking you about just now knocked all my plans into a
cocked hat."</p>

<p>"How was that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, it was like this," said the cow-girl college graduate, as
she pushed aside her corn bread, untasted, and, planting her elbows
upon her knee, propped her chin upon her palms, man fashion.
"In the spring of 1885, several years after I had graduated, my
father died, and mother and I came to Colorado and bought a
ranch at Plum Creek, some twenty-three miles south of Denver.
You see, my father had been an invalid, and ever since I can remember
we'd been chasing round from pillar to post, trying to
find a climate that agreed with him; so this was really what you
might call the first chance I had to go to work in earnest. It was

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>

a lovely quiet spot, an ideal place, I thought, for communing with
nature and pursuing a literary career. But it was not so to be.
Like&mdash;what's his name with a tender heel?"</p>

<p>"Achilles?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes, like Achilles, I had one weak spot that was going to be
my ruin. I was crazy about pets. Why, if it hadn't been for
that weak spot I might be wearing literary laurel instead of
lassoing cattle&mdash;but this is neither here nor there. What I
was going to say was that before I'd been settled on that ranch
three days some men came our way driving a herd of Texas cattle
to Denver, and, as a late snowstorm came up just then, they
decided to camp on good feed in the hills in front of my ranch.
That afternoon they came over to our house to buy bread, and
while they were there they mentioned to me that they had a
nice cow that had just calved, and offered if I would buy the
cow to throw in the calf, as they were just going to kill it. Well,
here was where my weak spot came in. No sooner did I hear
about those animals than nothing would do but that I should
have them for pets. Besides, the cow was offered mighty cheap,
only eighteen dollars, while I'd been going without milk rather
than pay the fifty or seventy-five dollars asked for a milch cow;
so now I thought was my chance to close a good bargain and get
two nice pets, beside. Yes, sir, I even planned while the men were
gone after those animals how I would domesticate them in a few
days."</p>

<p>"And it took longer?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Domesticate! I might as well have tried to domesticate an
active volcano&mdash;but I mustn't anticipate.</p>

<p>"My first impression of my pet cow wasn't exactly encouraging.
I had imagined her ambling serenely up to the house, mild-eyed
and gentle, with the little calflet trotting at her side. Instead,
she was dragged upon the scene by four men who had spent at
least an hour in catching her and bringing her to me. The calf,
meantime, after an equally exciting chase had been led up and tied
to a large plum bush.</p>

<p>"However, I wasn't one to let a little thing like that phase me.
I was determined to make friends with that cow; so when, about
two hundred yards from the house, the men threw her and took

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span>

off the rope I advanced with that idea. But I wasn't half so
anxious to make friends as the cow was. As soon as she set eyes
on me&mdash;and if ever an animal had the evil eye, that cow did&mdash;she
made a bee line for yours truly.</p>

<p>"&thinsp;'Look out,' shouted the men. But I was already footing it
pretty lively towards the thicket where the calf was tied, the cow
after me, snorting like a steam engine almost in my ear. The
next thing that I knew I had slipped and fallen on the ice in the
north side of the bushes with the cow on top. I believe that I
tried to grab the creature by her horns, with a wild hope that I
might hold her down until the men came to the rescue.</p>

<p>"I might as well have tried to hold down a hurricane. As she
rose so did I, and was on my feet twenty yards away before she
could see where she was at. Just as she rushed from the bush
and lunged after me, I saw a rope swing through the air, and the
next thing that devil-possessed cow knew she was tied to a clump of
thicket and left to meditate upon the evil of her ways."</p>

<p>"What did the men say to this?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Of course they made out that they were awfully surprised at
the cow's antics, fearfully scared at my close call, and all that;
but I saw them grinning and chuckling as if they were ready to
burst as they rode off, and I felt dead sure they'd planned to have
a double funeral, cow and calf both, if they hadn't found a tender-foot
to unload them on.</p>

<p>"However, I never was one to give in that I was beaten by anything,
first off, especially by a cow. Besides, that idea of having
two nice pets had got a great hold on me. I made up my mind
that if kindness could reclaim that erring cow she should be
coddled like an infant. So next morning, bright and early, I
started for the plum bush where she and the calf were tied, determined
to make peace. Fortunately, two gentlemen, who had
heard of the episode of the day before, rode over to see me that
morning and joined me on my peace-making expedition. No
sooner did the cow see me within thirty feet of her than she
gave a fearful surge; the rope that she was tied with&mdash;worn thin
by rubbing against the tree all night&mdash;gave way, and the cow
made for me as though fifty devils had taken possession of her
and were urging her on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>"I tell you I didn't stop to think about the power of kindness
on the brute creation. I simply yelled, 'Murder,' and made for
a sand gulch near by as though a band of wild Indians were on
my trail. As I reached the gulch and dropped ten feet or so
down the steep bank, digging my heels into the loose sand to
stop myself, that acrobatic cow sailed straight over my head and
lit about twenty yards below. At first I thought that she was
dead, but no such luck. In a moment she got up, looking foolish
and dazed, but very much alive, and began shaking her head
and pawing fiercely, when the two gentlemen reached down and
lifted me out, as much as to say, 'This is what I'll do when I
get hold of you.'&thinsp;"</p>

<p>"Which she didn't, I hope," I put in.</p>

<p>"No, indeed; you can be precious sure that I took particular
care that she didn't have another chance to get hold of me or to
get back into the yard again. For an hour or so after she had
hoisted herself out of the gulch she stood outside the fence that
separated the yard from the field, shaking her head and pawing
whenever she saw any of us at the doors or windows. At last,
towards evening, she trotted off with a zigzag wabble down the
bank towards the creek among the willows, and there she lay in
ambush, you might say, so that for a week after we didn't dare
to go down to make a garden or do anything else, for fear of
having that cow descend like a wolf on the fold."</p>

<p>"And after that week?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Well, finally she grew bolder, and ventured on the mesa near
the railroad track, where she made war on the section hands, and I
was warned that I must take her out of the field or they would
shoot her. So to prevent her from demoralizing the entire neighborhood
I had her killed and used her for beef. And tough eating
she was," said my hostess, laughing; "but in any case she
was better dead than alive, for there wasn't room for that cow and
me in the same country."</p>

<p>"But you've been telling me about the cow. What about the
heifer? I thought that you said that she was the cause&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. The heifer was the calf. Now, whether the cow
disowned the calf, or the calf the cow, I never found out. Anyway,
the day that the cow disappeared into the bottom land that little

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span>

calf trotted up to the house and tearfully begged to be loved.
Well, you might have thought I'd had enough of pets for one
while, but, no; the helplessness of that poor little calf so went to
my heart that for weeks I rode nine miles every day for milk, and
fed it to that little creature with my own hands."</p>

<p>"A sort of foster-mother," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was a mother to that little orphan calf. But, if you'll
believe me, it was a case of 'how sharper than a serpent's tooth
is an ungrateful child,' or however that goes. Yes, sir, that calf
followed in the evil course of its mother, only if anything it was
worse, sort of like Agrippina and her son, Nero, only this was a
daughter.</p>

<p>"You see, the cow was perfectly open about her evil deeds, but
the calf was underhanded. After trotting around me, looking as
innocent as though butter wouldn't melt in her mouth, she'd all
of a sudden disappear, and come back after a few days with an
ear torn and the skin raked off her side; and pretty soon I'd
hear that she'd been attacking horses or fighting other cows.</p>

<p>"One day she chased an unlucky workman out onto the railroad
bridge and kept him there until a train came along and the
engineer slackened enough to take him on and carry him to Plum
Station. Another time she got after a tramp that was camping on
the bottom land among the willows, and forced him to take
refuge in the forks of a crooked tree, where he roosted until one
of us went down and called off Miss Bossie. In fact, the only
return that calf ever made for all my loving care was to scare
away tramps. If I could have kept her around the house just for
that purpose she would have been one of the best investments I
ever made.</p>

<p>"But as years went by that calf became more and more abandoned
to evil. She would wander farther and farther from home,
until now I spend half my nights worrying about her and more
than half the day following her up and taking her home with
me."</p>

<p>"I should think you'd get rid of the creature," I interrupted.</p>

<p>"Kill her? Yes, I suppose that would be the most sensible
thing to do, but you know how it is about always loving the
prodigal son the most. Yes, sir; wherever that animal goes it

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span>

takes my heart with it, and, though it's nigh onto eleven years
old, I never can think of it as anything but a pet calf."</p>

<p>"And so it was bringing up that heifer that interfered with
your literary career?"</p>

<p>"Interfered? Well, I should say so! Back at the start I
did publish some poems in the local papers, and I read one or two
essays at the Zion Church literaries. But people wouldn't
believe they were original. No woman, they said, who spent her
time chasing wild cows over the country could write odes to
spring and essays on Shakespeare.</p>

<p>"My literary career was killed, blighted in the bud. And, as
my income was small and I had to do something to make out a
living, I've just turned my hand to anything that came along.</p>

<p>"Instead of gaining fame as the American George Eliot, I've
been called Colorado Cow-girl and Bronco Buster. Instead of
wielding the pen, I've driven a four-horse stage, branded cattle,
broken saddle horses, sung in a church choir, run a blacksmith's
shop, kept school, given music lessons, run a hotel, taught painting,
carried mail, roughed it on horseback all the way from Colorado
to Oregon, and taken a hand in pretty much everything else, except
shoveling wind off the roof. But there"&mdash;breaking off
suddenly&mdash;"you aren't interested in all this. What you want
now is rest and shelter.</p>

<p>"Take my outfit and make tracks for Wilkins ranch. Just
give the pony his head and he'll land you all right.</p>

<p>"It's over that way," rising and gesturing toward the southeast.</p>

<p>I tried to protest against this plan, but the Colorado cow-girl
was already several yards away.</p>

<p>"That's all right; meet you later at the ranch," she cried, turning
for a moment before she plunged into the thicket. "But
first," she added, with almost maternal solicitude, "I think I'll
just look around and see if I can't find that little speckled heifer."</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span style="margin-left: 0.2em">THE </span>
royal Malay tiger is no gentleman. If he
were, the following would never have been
told.</p>

<p>Punda-Tsang was an innkeeper. He was sole
proprietor of the Ballawari-Dâk, which is a
very big name for a very small native hotel
about sixty miles north of Penang, and on the high road to the
hunting-steppes of the Bukit, or hill-country. The quaint little
hospice clung to the mountain side like a swallow's nest, high
over the jungle-bedded Sungei, whose foaming, crashing torrents
came down from the upper mountains like an endless charge of
white cavalry to the sea. Punda was a good sort of a Malay,
which means a bad sort of anything else. That is, he would
plunder only on the securest principles, and never quarrel with
a bigger man nor a better armed one than he. In this he differed
from other Malays, who would plunder and knife upon no
principle or provocation whatever, if they thought there was a
ten-anna piece in the job.</p>

<p>But a deeper reading of this prosperous boniface of the jungles
revealed the fact that he was capable of love,&mdash;yes, even a
tender, human affection; and that little Iali, his five-year-old
daughter, was the object of a worship in his heart even more fervent
than that which he bestowed upon the five home-made clay
gods before which, in a dark corner of the Dâk, he burned a vast
deal of ill-smelling punk. The second year of Tsang's married
life had hardly begun when his beautiful wife was bitten by a
yellow viper while gathering healing herbs down in the valley.
When they found the poor creature she was dying&mdash;with a
little new-born babe in her arms. This calamity the bereaved
husband regarded as a direct visitation of the clay gods in the
corner; only the day before he had robbed a Kling hunter of his

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span>

rifle, leaving the poor fellow to make his way unarmed down to
the sea, where he ran upon a pair of half-starved <i>kukangs</i>, a
vicious species of Malay chimpanzee, in fleeing from which he
fell over the cliff and was dashed to pieces. And Punda-Tsang
always felt that that yellow viper was sent direct from the land
of the judging gods to avenge the blood of the poor Kling hunter.
But there was one thing that mitigated the harshness of this vengeance,&mdash;the
presence of the little child, whom he tenderly
cherished, and whom he had called Iali, which is to say "forgiven."
But even were not the little creature a messenger of
forgiveness to the penitent savage heart, she was more than
worthy his worship and love,&mdash;this child of the tropic forest,
restless and agile as a young panther, with lustrous black eyes
and a wild, wayward nature, much spoiled by the wayfarers and
fawned upon by the coolies that swarmed about the compound.</p>

<p>One day two British naval officers stopped at the Dâk on their
way down from a hunt in the hill country. We were seated
under the palms before the bungalow after tiffin, smoking cheroots,
while I listened to their exploits with interest. Suddenly four
native Malays approached, wheeling a live tiger in a clumsy
wooden cage, and halted before the Dâk. They were going to
dispose of him to a naturalist down on the coast, who had a method
of killing and stuffing animals by which the marvelous luster of
their skins was preserved. The forest king was certainly a magnificent
specimen. If you have never seen a live tiger fresh from
the jungles, take my word for it, the ordinary caged tiger at the
Zoo is as much like the former as canned strawberries are like the
fresh, lustrous fruit of June. The Englishmen evidently thought
so, too, as they concluded to buy him, and swear that they had
captured him, and then to present the beast to the London Zoo.
They bought the animal for forty Mexican dollars, sent the natives
back rejoicing, and started down towards the coast, while Punda-Tsang,
not contented with exacting fifty per cent commission
from the poor fellows for using his Dâk for a tiger mart, committed
the meanest act of his life. He slyly sawed one of the
cage bars nearly through in four places. Then he went to work
planning to waylay the tiger on his way back to his haunts after
he should break loose, which he knew would happen before the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>

Englishmen could get many miles down the valley. He quietly
pursued his planning until late that night, when he heard upon
good authority that the tiger had broken jail and nearly killed
one of his owners. Then he prepared to put his plans into action.</p>

<p>Here we reach the illustration of the first-mentioned fact, of
which Tsang was ready to take advantage: that the Malay tiger
is no gentleman. He knew that the beast will never walk up
leisurely and take his bite like a smooth and oily clubman at a
free lunch, but that the very instant that he smells blood he will
drop flat, and, even if the feast is a mile away, will begin a slow,
creeping journey towards it, wasting hours, perhaps, and working
up a terrific hunger in the meantime. When he has approached
within twenty feet of the prize, quivering with desire and terrible
with greed, he will leap into the air like a cannon ball and plunge
down upon his victim. Punda-Tsang knew all this; so he dug a
pit down the valley, constructed a network of branches over it,
and laid the quarter of a bullock upon it. Then he waited for the
tiger to scent the blood and make his slow, crawling journey,
knowing that when he made the grand twenty-foot leap he would
go crashing through the network into the pit below. Then
Tsang planned he would starve the beast, let down a cage baited
with more fresh meat, and, sliding the bars from above, haul the
captured tiger out and sell him over again. All of this might
have happened, but it didn't. Events somewhat stranger and
more terrible for Punda-Tsang interfered, doubtless as another
direct visitation of the vengeance of the little clay gods in the
bungalow corner, half concealed in clouds of punk-smoke.</p>

<p>As little Iali was the innkeeper's constant solace and companion,
she went with him to the pit-digging, her father explaining
to her the manner of capturing the "four-footed jungle-god," which
facts, instead of frightening the child, only helped to increase the
stock of her play gods and demons which she molded deftly
from the red clay of the ravine. With the appearance of the new
moon, that mascot of the Orientals, the pit was baited. For two
days nothing was heard of the tiger, and Punda-Tsang began to
fear that he had gone back to the hills by another route.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the third day I sat on the cliff's edge,
watching the mists rise from the roaring river bottom, a phenomenon

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span>

which always accompanies the closing day. Suddenly there
was a great shuffling of sandals about the compound, and I knew
something extraordinary was taking place. I turned quickly; the
big form of Punda-Tsang, the innkeeper, burst upon me suddenly,
his flat face as pallid as a demon's, ferocious, but with the ferocity
of nameless fear.</p>

<p>"Iali!" cried he hoarsely. "Have you seen Iali?"</p>

<p>"No!" I replied, almost in a whisper. He did not wait, but
sped towards the so-called bullock-sheds, which were really caves
cut in the solid rock beyond the Dâk. I had become attached to
the child, whose marvelous beauty had charmed, and whose weird
ways mystified me. But I had never been alone with her, knowing
that any accident happening to Iali while in my keeping
would result seriously for me&mdash;perhaps cost me my life. The
coolies were flying hither and thither, making the air ring with
their loud wails. Such agitation on the part of these vagabonds
roused me to a realization of the child's danger. Suddenly I
turned my eyes and thoughts in the direction of the ravine where
the tiger trap lay. I recalled vividly the child's interest in the
"jungle-god" who was to be captured in the deep pit; and, knowing
the little creature's absolute fearlessness, thought that, acting
upon some childish impulse, she might have strayed down the
narrow path to the pit. Meanwhile the wailing about me increased.</p>

<p>I dropped over the ledge, soon reaching the pathway by a short
route. As I penetrated the jungle, now suffused with mist in the
ruby glow of the expiring day, I realized with what risks to myself
I was entering this dangerous spot, all unarmed. I was still
debating whether or not to return for a weapon of defense, when,
as I leaped over a soft spot in the red clay, I saw two footprints
that shot terror into my heart; one was that of a mammoth tiger,
the other belonged to a little child. I dropped down beside them.
No. There was no mistaking them, so clear and fresh were both.
I rose to my feet, my head whirling, my ears half-deafened by the
noise of the jungle insects and the increasing roar of that river
beyond. Then I crept forward, scarcely daring to breathe, my
heart beating faster and faster with apprehension.</p>

<p>The distance to that tiger pit seemed to be doubled, and the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>

time that elapsed before reaching it everlasting. The crackling
of the leaves and twigs on the moss beneath my feet added to my
trepidations. Almost before I realized it I had reached the big
trap, and then halted short, thrilled by the sound of something
human. I looked up. Through the deepening mists and intervening
boughs I saw the little child-figure of Iali creeping out
upon the withered branches over the pit. For the instant I had
no power to move, nor dared I speak, lest, overcome with sudden
fright, the frail little one might lose her foothold. Suddenly a
new horror disclosed itself. What were those two glaring, cold,
yet fiery points just beyond the pit, burning their way through
the shadows? My God! It was the tiger. He was lying flat on
the ground, couchant, paws extended, quivering, ready for the
fatal spring.</p>

<p>In moments like these one's reasoning powers become super-human.
I saw that in all probability either Iali or I was to be
sacrificed, which one depended merely upon the caprice of the
wild beast. I had heard that the calm, steady, fearless stare of a
human is more terrifying to wild animals than guns that kill.
On the instant I resolved to practise it; it was my only expedient.
So I stared at those two coldly bright and glowing points of
light like a madman, without a quiver, without a doubt.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw the little figure waver on the dead branches
over the mouth of the pit, and then&mdash;oh, horrors! with a weak cry
poor little Iali had lost her foothold and slipped slowly through
the yielding boughs into the cave beneath. For a moment all
was silent. Then I heard her childish prattle. The soft sand
had broken Iali's fall and saved her life, while I was brought face
to face with the most awful problem of my life. For what seemed
hours, I stood like a pillar of stone, the sweat pouring down my
neck, my tongue hot and parched. One show of fear would, I
knew, be fatal. The "jungle-gods" are keen, like demons, measuring
strength with man. How long could I keep up this maddening
strain?&mdash;how long force upon the king-beast this illusion
of my superior will?</p>

<p>Suddenly, as I stood like one in a trance, facing this growing
problem, I was conscious of a stir in the reeds and underbrush at
my right hand. Though the sound caused me to tremble, I dared

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>

not take my eyes from the crouching monster beyond. The next
instant, a strange, huge shape crept stealthily out of the underwood,
and advanced into the clearing toward the pit,&mdash;a ponderous
black monster with the body of a beast, but lifting through the
grass the head and shoulders of a human colossus. It was a
mammoth orang-outang!</p>

<p>The tiger crouched lower. He seemed to be as nonplussed,
as stunned by the intrusion of this huge interloper as I was. In
motionless silence, he transferred his burning gaze to the mammoth
monster.</p>

<p>Advancing to the very edge of the pit, the huge ape slipped, but
he recovered. Sly beast! He saw that the branches were only a
blind. Then he walked around the edge of the trap, and knelt
down like a human being, slowly, deliberately reaching out his
long hairy arm till his giant hand clutched that bullock bone.
Oh, what joy that calm, providential deed brought to my heart!
Then, to my intense relief, the orang slowly dragged the great
mass of flesh off the network of branches upon the solid ground.</p>

<p>For a moment longer the gleam of those two terrible eyes, now
like peepholes into hell, followed the unsuspecting pilferer. Then
came a rustle, a strange shriek like sudden thunder, a bound, and
a roar, and the "jungle-god" had sprung into the air, and came
down like a flashing avalanche full upon the broad body of the
kneeling orang. A single paw struck the mammoth ape in the
small of the back, and never shall I forget the sound of that blow
which broke the bones of the orang's spine like a cannon ball.
With an almost human groan, the rescuer of my life and hers I
came to save gave up the booty, together with his own life.
Then the tiger, with a final flash of eyes full into my own,
snatched up the carcass of the bullock in his flaming jaws, and slid
off into the thick of the jungle.</p>

<p>I have often wondered since how things would have turned out
if that tiger <i>had</i> been a gentleman.</p>

lacked three minutes of five by the big clock
in the tower when the east-bound Chicago
express rumbled into the station at Buffalo.
The train had not yet come to a standstill when
a hatless man jumped from the platform of the
rear sleeping-car and ran across the tracks into
the depot restaurant. A few minutes later he reappeared, carrying
a cup of coffee in one hand and a small paper bag in the
other.</p>

<p>With these he hurriedly made his way back to the car through
a straggling procession of drowsy tourists, who were taking advantage
of the train's five minutes' stop to breathe the crisp morning
air. The last of these had already resumed his seat when the man
without a hat again appeared at the lunch counter, returned the
borrowed dishes, and ordered coffee for himself. He had just
picked up the cup and was raising it to his lips when the conductor's
"All aboard" rang through the station.</p>

<p>Leaving the coffee untouched, he thrust a five-dollar bill at the
attendant, grabbed his change, and started in pursuit of the moving
train. He had almost reached it when an unlucky stumble sent
the coins in his hand rolling in all directions along the floor.
Quickly recovering himself and paying no heed to his loss, he redoubled
his efforts, and, though losing ground at every step, kept
up the hopeless chase to the end of the station. There he stopped,
panting for breath. The slip had proved fatal. He had missed
the train!</p>

<p>As he stood staring wildly through the clouds of dust that rose
from the track, a young woman, evidently deeply agitated, suddenly
appeared in the doorway of the vanishing car. Upon seeing
him, she made frantic attempts to leap from the platform, when
she was seized by a man and pulled back into the car. When the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span>

door had closed upon the two the bareheaded man in the station
faced about and philosophically muttered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's fate!"</p>

<p>Then, after pausing a few moments, as if to collect his thoughts,
he slowly retraced his steps to the scene of his mishap and began
calmly searching for his lost change. Circling closely about,
his eyes scanning the floor, he succeeded in recovering first one
and then another of the missing coins, until finally, after repeated
rounds, he lacked only one dollar of the whole amount. At
this point he paused, clinked the recovered coins in his hand,
looked at his watch, and then started on a final round. As this
failed to reveal the missing piece, he gave up the search, transferred
the contents of his hands to his trousers' pocket, and
started in the direction of the telegraph office.</p>

<p>He had proceeded perhaps twenty paces when it occurred to
him to turn about and cast one more look along the floor. As
he did so his eye fell upon a shining object lodged in an opening
between the rail and planked floor, a few feet from where he
stood. He stooped to examine it, and, seeing that it was the missing
coin, reached for it, but found the opening too narrow to
admit his fingers. He tried to recover the piece with his pocket-knife,
and, failing in this attempt, took his lead-pencil, with which,
after repeated attempts, he succeeded in tossing it upon the floor.</p>

<p>With an air of subdued satisfaction, he walked away, and was
about to convey the coin to his pocket when a sudden impulse
led him to examine it. Holding it up before his eyes, he stopped,
scrutinized every detail, and as he turned it over and over the
puzzled look on his face changed to one of rigid astonishment.
For fully a minute he stood as if transfixed; then, rousing himself
and looking anxiously about as if to see if any one had
observed him, he hurried to the cashier's desk in the restaurant,
and, producing the bright silver dollar, asked the girl if she happened
to remember from whom she received it.</p>

<p>She didn't remember, but would exchange it for another, she
said, if he wished. Politely declining the offer and apologizing
for having troubled her, he said that, as the coin he held in his
hand was separating a loving wife from her husband, he wished
very much to find some trace of its former owner. The girl

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span>

looked up, thought for a moment, then, pulling out the cash
drawer, and examining its contents, said she might have received
it from the conductor of the Lake Shore express which had left for
Cleveland at 3.15. She now recalled that when she came on
duty at midnight there was no silver dollar among the change in
the cash drawer, and that the only one she remembered receiving
was from Sleeping-Car Conductor Parkins.</p>

<p>The man thanked her and hastened to the telegraph office,
where he sent this message:&mdash;<br /><br /></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Conductor, East Bound Chicago Express,</span></p>
<p><span class ="smcap sig-left16">Utica, N. Y.</span></p>

<p><span class="p3">"Please ask lady in section seven of sleeping-car Catawba to</span><br />
await her husband at Delavan House, Albany.</p>

<p class="sig-left16">"A. J. HOBART."<br /><br /></p>

<p>After requesting the operator to kindly rush the despatch, he
proceeded to the ticket office, procured a seat in the 5.45 fast
mail for Cleveland, and, with his hand clutching the coin in his
pocket and his eyes fixed upon the floor, meditatively paced up
and down the platform, waiting for the train to arrive.</p>

<p>As he did so he was disconcerted to find himself the object of
wide-spread curiosity; even the newsboys with the morning papers
favored him with an inquiring stare as they passed. Wondering
what was amiss, he suddenly put his hand to his head, which furnished
an instant explanation. He was hatless.</p>

<p>Looking at the big clock, he saw that it lacked ten minutes of
train time, and, hastily crossing over to the farther track, he disappeared
through the west end of the station.</p>

<p>Among the passengers who boarded the 5.45 fast mail for
Cleveland when it thundered into the station, ten minutes later,
was the bareheaded gentleman of a few minutes ago, now wearing
a stylish derby. Once in the train, he settled himself in his
seat with a sigh of relief and satisfaction. Not until then did
the really remarkable character of the situation dawn upon him.
On the very day which he had hailed as one of the happiest of
his life he was traveling at the rate of about sixty miles an hour
away from the girl he loved devotedly and to whom he had

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span>

been married just seventeen hours. A queer opening of his honeymoon!
In his anxiety to get a cup of coffee for his wife, he had
lost his hat, then lost his change, and, lastly, lost the train.</p>

<p>Why did he not follow his bride at once? What mysterious
spell had come upon this seventeen-hour bridegroom that he
should fly from her as swiftly as the fast express could carry him?
His hand held the solution of the problem&mdash;simple, yet unexplainable&mdash;a
silver dollar! It held the secret he must unravel before
he could return to her; it was not then that he loved her
less, but that this bit of precious metal had suddenly developed an
occult power that had turned their paths, for the present, in
opposite directions.</p>

<p>At the first stopping place he sent another message, which
read as follows:&mdash;<br /><br /></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mrs. A. J. Hobart</span>, Delavan House,
Albany, N. Y.</p>
<p><span class="p3">"Cannot possibly reach Albany before to-morrow morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sig-left21-5 smcap">"Ansel."</span><br /><br /></p>

<p>With his brain filled with excited thoughts, the young man
entered the sleeping-car office at Cleveland four hours later and
asked for Conductor Parkins. He was told that this official
would not be on duty before night, though possibly he might be
at his home on St. Clair Street.</p>

<p>To the address given him the indefatigable young man repaired
at once, and found the genial gentleman for whom he
sought breakfasting with his family. He kindly gave audience at
once to his visitor.</p>

<p>"This coin, which you gave the cashier of the restaurant in
Buffalo," said the latter, revealing it in the palm of his hand;
"can you tell me from whom you received it?"</p>

<p>Parkins remembered receiving cash from but two passengers
the night before, one a traveling man who got off in Cleveland,
and the other a woman whose destination was Erie. The stranger
might ascertain their names by consulting the car diagram at the
ticket office. "You seem interested in the coin," he added, smiling.</p>

<p>"I am, for a good reason," laughed the young man in reply.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span>

"It is separating a man from his wife." And with these engimatical
words he made his adieu, with thanks, hastened to the
ticket office, and an hour later was scouring the city for one
Richard Spears.</p>

<p>The register of the Stillman House contained the freshly written
name of "Richard Spears, Providence, R. I.," but that gentleman,
when found in his room showing samples of hardware to a prospective
buyer, regretted that he could not throw any light on the
particular dollar his visitor held up to his gaze, and remembered
distinctly that he had given the conductor a two-dollar bill in payment
for his berth. He came from a section, he said, where
people took no stock in silver dollars.</p>

<p>It was three o'clock in the afternoon when a man got off the
train at Erie and inquired of the cabmen and depot master regarding
a lady who had arrived on the early train from Buffalo. An
hour later he was driving along a country road some miles south of
the town inquiring for the Wickliffe farm.</p>

<p>As he finally drove up to the house which was his destination
he was conscious of a strange excitement. This, he realized, was
probably his only remaining chance to trace the coin by whose
mysterious power he had been drawn into this wild chase with
the hope of identifying its former owner. He took a hasty note
of the general features of the place. It had a comfortable, well-to-do
look; a two-story house, white, with green blinds. Most of
these were closed, as is customary with country houses, but the
windows at the right of the big front door, opening on a small
porch, were shaded only by white curtains. There was a sound of
voices within as he stepped up to the door and rapped.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wickliffe, a pleasant-faced little woman, sat surrounded
by three children and a neighbor's wife, to whom she was displaying
some purchases. As one of the children opened the door,
admitting the stranger into this animated scene, she was standing
before a mirror trying on a new bonnet, which was eliciting extravagant
praises from the neighbor.</p>

<p>After listening to his story, Mrs. Wickliffe said that her memory
was so treacherous that she really couldn't say for certain whether
or not she gave the conductor the shining dollar, but that if
she did she must have received it from her son in Germantown,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span>

Pa., from a visit to whose house she had just returned, and
who before her departure had exchanged some money for her.
She added that, as she took no interest in coin collecting, a dollar
was simply a dollar to her and that she thought a woman was
very foolish to take up with a fad which might ruin her happiness.</p>

<p>Her unknown caller thought so, too, admired her taste in
millinery, took the address of her son, and, clutching the fatal
coin more firmly than ever, drove back to Erie, where he boarded
the New York night express.</p>

<p>To the young man who still clutched the silver dollar sleep
was impossible. A multitude of exciting fancies crossed his brain.
The developments he hoped to bring about, the curious solution
of the problem, its effect upon his future, and the future of one
so dear to him,&mdash;all this murdered sleep for him as effectually as
did the crime on Lady Macbeth's soul. It drove him into the
smoking-car, where he sank into a seat and planned and conjectured
between puffs of Havana smoke until the train reached Albany.
So completely absorbed had he become in the solution of this
knotty problem in which his accident of the morning had involved
him, and so convinced was he that the information must be for the
time kept a secret, that he actually began to dread what was clearly
inevitable,&mdash;the explanation he must shortly make to his wife.</p>

<p>His inclination was to tell her all. His duty to others forbade
this. After pondering over the matter, he decided to explain that
he had a happy surprise in store for her, one that had an important
bearing on their future, and which unfortunately necessitated
a change in their plans for a honeymoon in Europe.</p>

<p>This, on reaching the Delavan House, he expressed to a very
pretty and very anxious little woman who was awaiting him,
together with a good many other things not necessary to this
story. And, instead of the steamer for Europe, the reunited pair
took a train for Philadelphia. Early the next day the young
man presented himself at the office of Dr. James Wickliffe, at Germantown,
who smilingly admitted having given the shining dollar
to his mother two days before. He had received the coin from a
patient, a letter-carrier named John Lennon, and remembered it
because of the following strange story, related to him by Lennon
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[48]</span></p>

<p>A few days before, the carrier was engaged in delivering mail
from door to door along Vine Street, Philadelphia, when a zigzag
trip across the street and back again brought him to the narrow
stairway of a dingy brick house, in front of which hung an
enormous brass key bearing the word "Locksmith." Here he
paused to draw a little parcel from his bundle. As he did so he
heard something fall with a metallic clink upon the stone pavement.
He looked and saw that it was a silver dollar, which
rolled toward the gutter and came to a stop close by the curb.
Hastening to pick it up, he instantly dropped it with a cry of
pain.</p>

<p><i>The coin was almost red hot!</i></p>

<p>The letter-carrier stood nursing his hand and thinking for two
or three minutes. Silver dollars do not commonly drop out of
the sky. But that this one should thus fall like a meteorite in
a condition too heated for handling was certainly more than surprising&mdash;it
was astounding! The man looked up at the dingy
brick house and examined it attentively, noting that the ground
floor was occupied as a green grocery and that all of the windows
were shut save one in the third story.</p>

<p>Then he kicked the mysterious coin into a puddle, fished it
out again with his fingers, and put it into his trousers' pocket.
He was about to investigate further, when some small boys
called his attention to the fact that it was the first day of April,
whereupon he proceeded on his way. He gave no further thought
to the matter until that night, when he found that his thumb
and forefinger had been so badly burned as to require treatment.</p>

<p>The next morning he called upon the doctor, who dressed the
painful hand and received the mysterious coin in payment for
his services.</p>

<p>That night, behind locked doors in one of the officers' rooms
of the United States Mint in Chestnut Street, two men were engaged
in a long whispered conference. The wife of one of the
men, as she sat in her room in the Continental Hotel, anxiously
waiting for her husband, was beginning to wonder whether, after
all, marriage was a failure!</p>

<p>Two days later, in speaking of the seizure of over forty thousand
bogus silver dollars and the clever capture of three of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 49]</span>

most dangerous counterfeiters that ever attacked the currency of
the United States, the <i>Daily News</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The most remarkable part of the whole story is that one of
the coins, fresh from the machine of one of the counterfeiters, fell
out of a third-story window near which he was working, was
picked up while almost red hot by a letter-carrier, and passed
as genuine through various hands until it reached Buffalo, where,
by the merest accident, it came into the possession of Mr. Ansel
Hobart of the Secret Service. That gentleman noticed an imperfection
at one point of its rim, and succeeded in tracing the coin
to the headquarters of the gang on Vine Street in this city, where,
under the cloak of a locksmith shop and green grocery business,
six hundred of the spurious coins were turned out daily. So admirably
were these counterfeits executed as to defy scrutiny save
by experts of the Government. The coins were not cast in
molds after the ordinary fashion, but were struck with a die, and
plated so thickly with silver as to withstand tests by acids. The
defect which led to the discovery was found only in the one coin
already spoken of, and it is supposed that it was this defect that
caused the piece to spring from the finishing machine and fall out
of the window."</p>

<p>And the New York newspapers of three days later contained
the intelligence that the White Star steamer "Majestic," which
sailed for Liverpool that day, had among her passengers Mr. and
Mrs. Ansel J. Hobart, of Chicago, Illinois.</p>

<p>"I cannot speak too enthusiastically of what my dressmaker
has done for the last two seasons. All the former
annoyance of heavy sleeves (which are also very hot in
warm weather) has been done away with, and it is such
pleasure to me to use no special care of the skirt when
either riding or boating as I am sure every fold will instantly
disappear the moment I walk."</p>

<p>"What different materials do you use to accomplish
this?"</p>

<p>"Why, really the same, only you know the <span class="smcap">American
Hair Cloth Co.</span>&mdash;I believe that is the name&mdash;make one
grade of linings so thin as not to be objectionable to the
thinest white material even, and then the heavier grades
which are just as suitable for winter use as for summer,
and all their styles in either gray, black or white."</p>

<p>"How much does this really add to the weight of the
skirt without any lining?"</p>

<p>"My dressmaker says that an entire skirt if it were
made up as a separate skirt of seven yards would weigh but 12 ounces, and if one should use their 170/3 it is
almost as light as air itself."</p>

<p>"Why, these figures are new to me; what do they mean?"</p>

<p>"I took pains to investigate that, and their <b>10/4</b>, <b>10/5</b> and <b>98/3</b> is the style usually used for skirts and can
be had in either gray or black, though of course they make heavier grades, principally used by tailors."</p>

<p>"Either the <b>84/3</b>, <b>146/3</b>, <b>170/3</b>, <b>184/4</b> or <b>200/4</b>, is all right for thin sleeves, so that if the dealer has not all
these styles he ought to have one surely."</p>

<p>"I am very glad for this information, for I confess that while I have been forced to follow the fashion. It has
been at great discomfort, especially in the hot weather, with what I have had used for linings; and I had really
no knowledge of these different grades, or in fact that <span class="smcap">Hair Cloth Crinoline</span> was really the perfect thing to
be used for both skirts and sleeves."</p>

of a single case of indigestion, loss of sleep, skin disease, or scurvy while

<p>The stomach requires action&mdash;it is so constructed that from the very
first it is made for action. With the youngest infant the quantity of nourishment
from the natural food (the mother's milk) is much less, because the
stomach is incapable of taking care of as much as it can later, but at the
same time action is going on, and nature does its work as the child grows,
so it can take stronger food; therefore, the special directions which
have been the result of experience so adapt themselves to the age of the
child as to fulfill those requirements.</p>

<p>Little babies cannot be successfully fed daily by pouring hot water on
something that makes food. <b>It must be properly cooked</b>, and properly prepared
especially for the babies' delicate stomachs, if you wish to save them.</p>

<p>It has been said by some that children could not assimilate starch, yet
we believe it is a proper carbon to have in food. The only carbon in many
foods is sugar. Scurvy is not uncommonly a result of the continued use of
food not sufficiently nutritious. The disfiguring eczema seen on the face
and scalp is a result from the same cause.</p>

<p><span class="xlarge"><b>Ridge's Food</b></span> is so prepared that only the normal action of the stomach
is required to produce healthful growth and development,
and the result has been good digestion, sound, healthy bodies, good teeth,
strong, straight limbs, and a well-formed brain; the child becomes a
model of healthful strength and childish beauty when fed on <b>Ridge's
Food</b>, properly prepared&mdash;and its long continuance does not produce
Scurvy and skin disease in its many forms. Do not take our word for it,

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>How many people realize the necessity of drinking large
quantities of water in order to keep in absolutely good health?
When it is remembered that nearly two thirds of the substance,
by weight, of the human body is in the form of water, included in
the composition of the various tissues, the importance of using
water in liberal quantities internally becomes at once apparent.
The most eminent physiologists have computed that, in order to
supply the losses by excretions and evaporation taking place in
the human body, it is necessary to drink from a half to one gallon
of water daily. This, too, in addition to the water contained in
the beverages, such as tea, coffee, etc., which are in common use.
It is an uncontested and fundamental truth of hygiene that water
supplied for drinking purposes must be of the very best quality
and perfectly pure and free from the slightest trace of organic
matter. The desire for water of this kind among intelligent
people is seen in the large number of natural waters now offered
for sale. It is known, too, that in the treatment of many
common forms of disease natural mineral waters are one of the
most important factors.</p>
<p>Of all of these waters, none are equal to the Londonderry Lithia
Water. The array of reliable medical testimony in its favor is
overwhelming and shows that all good livers should use this
water liberally from time to time. Londonderry stands decidedly
ahead of all the lithia waters, a fact that has been proven by
actual investigation and experience.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="large"><b>The Story of Our Post Office.</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Marshall Cushing</span>, Private Secretary to Postmaster-General Wanamaker.<br /><br /></p>

<p>A complete story of our National Post Office Department, turned inside out; crammed full of
information and the most romantic, laughable, tragic, and wonderful incidents on record. It
includes descriptions of mail transportation in this country and across the water; of the manufacture
of stamps and postal cards; of the methods and treasures of the Dead Letter Office. It
gives pictures and sketches of the chief postmasters of the country, relates the government's encounters
with frauds, lotteries, and green goods men, and describes the work of women in this department.
The author is widely known as one of the raciest and ablest writers in America. The
position he has occupied with the Postmaster-General of the United States for four years is the
highest commendation of his work.</p>

<p class="large"><b>The Story of Government.</b></p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Henry Austin</span>.<br /><br /></p>

<p>This work treats of Evolution and Government, as traced from animals to savage tribes,
upwards through the successive stages of barbarism and civilization. By means of a wealth of
anecdote and allusion it introduces the reader into gypsy camps, Fenian and Nihilistic meetings,
criminal colonies, modern republics, and picturesque courts of bygone centuries. It is a treasury
of knowledge previously unpublished, taught in no text-book, and unknown in universities;
written so plainly and picturesquely that a child will understand and a philosopher enjoy. Its
field is the world, and its audience humanity. Indorsed by Edward Everett Hale, Vicar-General
William Byrne, Gen. Douglas Frazar, Edward Bellamy, and many others represented in the world
of letters. One of the foremost women of the day, Mary A. Livermore, says: "<i>The section relating

<hr class="r25" />

<div class="xxxlarge center"><b>Important Announcements for the Fall of 1895.</b></div>

<hr class="r25" />

<p>The publishers take pleasure in announcing an unusual amount of good
fiction. Early issues of the Atlantic will contain <b>The Apparition of
Gran'ther Hill</b>, by <i>Rowland E. Robinson</i>; <b>Pilgrim Station</b>, by <i>Mary
Hallock Foote</i>; <b>Athenaise, a Creole Story</b>, by <i>Kate Chopin</i>; <b>The End of
the Terror</b>, by <i>Robert Wilson</i>, a Southern writer. Aside from these, there
will be stories by Mrs. <i>Wiggin, Henry James, L. Dougall, Ellen Mackubin</i>,
and others.</p>

<p>Conspicuous in the Fall issues will be papers of Travel. <i>Lafcadio Hearn</i>
will contribute sketches and interpretations of the new Japan. There will
be further papers in Mr. Peabody's <b>An Architect's Vacation</b> series, the
forthcoming one being entitled <b>The Venetian Day</b>. A delightful paper of
Spanish travel by Mrs. <i>Miriam Coles Harris</i> can be promised, and <i>Alice
Brown</i> will write of a visit to the original Cranford. <i>Bradford Torrey</i> will
publish further sketches of life and nature in his Tennessee haunts. Other
articles of special interest, which can perhaps be classed under this head,
will be <b>Reminiscences of Eastern Travel</b> by Miss <i>Harriet Waters Preston</i>;
and <i>Josiah Flynt</i>, who has become an authority on the vagrant, will contribute
one of his entertaining studies of tramp life, <b>The Children of the Road</b>.</p>

<p>The subject of <b>Education</b> will, as usual, receive attention. The Atlantic
was the first of the leading magazines to make the discussion of important
educational questions one of the features of its pages. In early issues will
be printed articles by President <i>Tucker</i>, of Dartmouth, and Professor
<i>J. H. Wright</i>, of Harvard.</p>

<p>The usual departments and the exhaustive book-reviews will continue to
be features of each issue.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
